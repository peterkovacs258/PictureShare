<h3>Welcome to picture share!</h3>
<p>This site is a free oppurtinity to share your picture with others</p>
<p> Every shared picture is available for everyone who is registered on the website,
and is free to like, share, or download.</p>
<h3>But we have some rules!</h3><p> When you upload a picture you agree that from now on it can be used
for all kind of purposes on the internet, like a stock photo</p>
<p>Every picture has a like counter, if a picture reaches way more dislikes than likes, it automatically gets
deleated from the site.On the opposite, if a picture gets a lots of likes, it goes to the hall of fame,
and we will give you an electronic pat on the shoulder for that, and some 'PS'(stands for picture share) points for your account</p>
<h3>So why is this good for you?</h3>
<p>If you feel like amazing photographer, or just someone who can make creative pictures,
this can be your way to fly off, and get some popularity!</p>
<p>Or if you just feel bored, and dont know what to do with your time, whats better than looking at some random
pictures, and rate them for your own will.</p>
